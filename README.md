This is a Substitution Cipher Program written with Java

A substitution cipher is like a secret code where each letter in a message is replaced with a different letter or symbol based on a secret code key. To understand the message, you need the key to figure out what each letter stands for. If someone knows the key, they can easily decode the message.
